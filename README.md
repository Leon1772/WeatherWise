# WeatherWise üå§Ô∏è

A sleek, pixel-art inspired weather application that provides real-time weather information with a unique visual style.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Get current weather conditions for major Chinese cities
- **Pixel Art Design**: Retro-inspired UI with pixel-perfect aesthetics and animated weather icons
- **Smart Caching**: Local storage for faster loading and reduced API calls
- **Weather Trends**: View temperature trends with a pixel-style chart
- **Optimized Performance**: Loads in under 1 second with cached data
- **Resilient Icon System**: Multi-layered fallback system for weather icons

## Weather Icons

We use Animated SVG Weather Icons from [basmilius/weather-icons](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons). To prevent losing these icons:

1. The icons are stored locally in `/assets/weather-icons/`
2. Each icon is optimized for performance
3. Backup repository: [Weather Icons Backup](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
4. Automatic fallback to CDN if local icons are unavailable
5. In-memory caching for instant loading
6. Local storage backup for offline access

### Icon Usage

```javascript
// Example of how we use the weather icons
const iconPath = `/assets/weather-icons/${weatherCode}.svg`;
```
